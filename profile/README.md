# TerraPraxis

**TerraPraxis is a climate solution incubator for neglected areas of the climate challenge.** 

Powered by philanthropy, TerraPraxis is a nonprofit organization that innovates and incubates scalable solutions for a livable planet and human prosperity. We accelerate solutions for neglected areas of the climate challenge—particularly the difficult-to-decarbonize sectors of industrial heat, coal, and heavy transport.


## Transforming Modeling
TerraPraxis is developing a “Data Book” to support global modeling organizations in representing energy transition risks and deployment feasibility to enable a more realistic picture for investors and policy makers of what is possible on the path to Net Zero.
